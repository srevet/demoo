🛵🔒 Redefining Rider Safety: An IoT Breakthrough! 🚀

Imagine a world where every 2-wheeler ride begins with a pledge to safety. 🎯 Introducing our groundbreaking project that seamlessly integrates IoT technology into rider protection.

🪖 Helmet Guardian: Our innovative helmet is equipped with an intelligent IR sensor that ensures the rider's helmet is securely fastened before the ignition comes to life. Safety is no longer optional; it's automatic.

🚫 Alcohol-Free Zone: We're taking a stand against alcohol-impaired riding. Our project incorporates an advanced MQ3 gas sensor within the helmet to detect alcohol levels. When responsibility meets innovation, the result is a ride that won't start if the rider's had a drink.

🔌 The Tech Behind: Through the power of ESP8266 NodeMCU technology, the helmet communicates wirelessly with the bike's NodeMCU. The bike's system analyzes real-time data, making ignition decisions based on safety criteria.

📱 Smart Data Display: Stay informed with our locally-built app created using MIT App Inventor. Real-time alcohol level readings are seamlessly displayed, empowering riders with critical insights.

🌐 Connected Safety: Both helmet and bike circuits communicate flawlessly over a common WiFi network, courtesy of their respective NodeMCU ESP8266. It's a synergy of innovation and technology working together to ensure your safety.

🛣️ A Safer Ride for All: This project isn't just about technology; it's about cultivating a culture of responsible riding. Join us in building a community where innovation fosters safety and every journey begins with a commitment to protection.
